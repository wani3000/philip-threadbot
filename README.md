# Philip Threadbot

Philip Threadbot is an admin-operated automation system that turns Philip Designer's experience, lecture topics, and project history into reviewable Threads drafts, daily Telegram bot notifications, and scheduled Threads publishing. The business goal is to convert consistent personal-brand content into lecture inquiries and design project leads.

## Current Context

Initial setup is now in progress. The repository started empty, so the current focus is establishing project structure, execution docs, Jira hierarchy, and the first non-UI infrastructure tasks.

## Core Directory Structure

- `apps/web` — Next.js dashboard shell and future admin routes
- `apps/api` — Express API shell, cron entrypoints, and backend integrations
- `research.md` — current repository and architecture analysis
- `plan.md` — Jira-aligned execution plan and task-by-task implementation notes

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 App Router
- Node.js + Express
- TypeScript
- npm workspaces
- Planned: Supabase, Telegram Bot API, Claude/OpenAI/Gemini, Threads Graph API
